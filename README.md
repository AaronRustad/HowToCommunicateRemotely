How To Communicate Remotely
===========================
This document is a manifesto of sorts, declaring how to communicate effectively when working remotely.


Asynchronous Group Chat
========================
There are many group chat applications available. [HipChat](http://hipchat.com) and [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/) are both popular hosted comerical solutions. [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) is an alternative that may work for you. It's free, but you may be required to host it yourself.


Email

Video Conference
================

Meetings
========
- The person who calls the meeting is obligated to be ready *on time* with all necessary resources prepared. If a video conference is requested, setting up accounts, software, A/V equipment must be ready prior to the start of the meeting. Similarily, invitees to a meeting must also be prepared to start on time.

### Pull Requests
When the developer feels that code is ready to be added to master, a Pull Request is opened and the rest of the team is notified. 

#### The Developer

The act of issuing a Pull Request is stating a number of facts:

1. The code is ready to be merged into production
2. The code adheres to the team's coding standards and best practices
3. The code is sufficiently tested
4. The automated test suite has successfully completed on the development machine

#### The Reviewer

The reviewer of the code can be any person on the team. There should not be a situation where one person is responsible for reviewing any specific part of the application. 

The act of accepting a Pull Request is staging a number of facts:

1. I've reviewed the code
2. I've understood the intent of the Pull Request
3. I accept partial responsability for the code being merged into master

#### Do's and Don'ts
Only comment on a Pull Request if it's going to help improve the Pull Request itself or your understanding of it.
